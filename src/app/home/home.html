            So you finall y decided to buy that new phone 
            and found it in website, at a great price. However,
            you are still not sure and want to find out if its performance will be the same, two years ahead in time? If you ask the customer support of that website, they will surely somehow convince you that what you wanna buy is the perfect product. Imagine if you can ask somebody that has already purchased this exact same product, without leaving the site?
